# CS430-Project4 Ray Tracing
raytrace.c

This application takes in the desired width and height of the output image, the input 'json' filename, and the ouput 'ppm' file name. It then converts the scene defined in the json file into a ppm p6 image file.

This application can only raycast sphere and plane objects, and takes in lights to shade them.

It recursively calculates reflectivity and refractivity.
